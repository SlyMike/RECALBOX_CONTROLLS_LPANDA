# RECALBOX_CONTROLS_FOR_LATTEPANDA
Encoder for LattePanda boards running RECALBOX, also runs on Arduino Leonardo.

Nothing special, just rehashed the projects below for running RecalBox on a LattePanda PC and using the built in GPIO to control
basic functionality.
KEY MAPPING TAKEN FROM HERE: https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/KEYBOARD-ENCODER-CONFIGURATION-%28EN%29

Mostly untested, simple enough to modify, D13 illuminates when I/O pins are shorted to GND for sanity check.
