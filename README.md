# RECALBOX_CONTROLS_LPANDA
Encoder for LattePanda boards running RECALBOX, also runs on Arduino Leonardo.

Nothing special, just rehashed the projects below for running RecalBox on a LattePanda PC and using the built in GPIO to control
basic functionality.

Mostly untested, simple enough to modify, D13 illuminates when I/O pins are shorted to GND for sanity check.

*  DERIVED FROM ROMBUSPINBALL https://github.com/circuitbeard/rombus-pinball which is
*  Borrowed heavily from Pimoronis Picade sketch at https://github.com/pimoroni/Picade-Sketch/tree/master/Picade
